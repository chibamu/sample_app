How you handle sabotage or other bullying can affect your career prospects. You don't want to come across as a pushover, but you shouldn't overreact either, according to Megan Slabinski, executive director of The Creative Group.

"Not everyone who slights you is doing it on purpose," Slabinski says. "Before you confront someone, see if you may have played a role in the problem, or if your colleague wasn't aware of the issue. It's also wise to ask a mentor for candid feedback."

Slabinski also recommends looking for patterns before crying foul. "If it's happened a few times, it's definitely time to speak up," she says. "If someone is purposely trying to make you look bad, you want to let him or her know that you're aware of the situation, and you're not going to let it continue."
